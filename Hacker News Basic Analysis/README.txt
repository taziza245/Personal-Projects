Project Overview
- This project conducts basic analysis of user engagement on Hacker News by comparing two types of postsâ€”Ask HN and Show HN. The goal is to determine which type of post gets more comments and whether the time of posting affects engagement.

Dataset
- We use a reduced dataset of around 20,000 posts, filtered to include only those with comments. Key columns include:

id: Unique post identifier
title: Post title
num_points: Upvotes minus downvotes
num_comments: Number of comments
created_at: Post submission time

Objectives
- Do Ask HN or Show HN posts get more comments on average?
- Does posting time affect the number of comments?

Key Findings
- Ask HN posts receive more comments on average, especially between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM (EST).
- Show HN posts tend to earn more points, particularly when posted late at night.

How to Run
- Download the project files and place the hacker_news.csv in the same directory as the notebook.
- Run the Jupyter Notebook (Exploring Engagement on Hacker News.ipynb).
- Follow the step-by-step analysis in the notebook.
